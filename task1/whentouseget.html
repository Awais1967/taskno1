      <h1>When to Use GET and POST?</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Overview of GET and POST Methods</h2>
        <p>
          GET and POST are the two most commonly used HTTP methods for making
          requests to a server. Understanding when to use each is crucial for
          building efficient and secure web applications.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>GET Method</h2>
        <p>
          The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. It requests
          data from a specified resource, and the parameters are included in the
          URL. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>GET /search?q=example HTTP/1.1</pre>
        <p>Key characteristics of GET:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
             Read-only:  GET requests should not modify any data on the
            server.
          </li>
          <li>
             Idempotent:  Multiple identical GET requests should have the same
            effect as a single request.
          </li>
          <li>
             Cacheable:  GET requests can be cached by browsers, which helps
            to reduce server load and improve performance.
          </li>
          <li>
             Limited Data:  The amount of data that can be sent is limited by
            the URL length.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use GET when you need to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Retrieve data without causing any side effects.</li>
          <li>
            Load a web page or retrieve data that doesn't need to be secured.
          </li>
          <li>Bookmark or share the URL with parameters included.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>POST Method</h2>
        <p>
          The POST method is used to send data to a server to create or update a
          resource. The data is included in the body of the request, not in the
          URL. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=John&age=30</pre
        >
        <p>Key characteristics of POST:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
             Modifies Data:  POST requests can create or update resources on
            the server.
          </li>
          <li>
             Not Idempotent:  Multiple identical POST requests may result in
            different outcomes.
          </li>
          <li> Not Cacheable:  POST requests are generally not cached.</li>
          <li>
             Unlimited Data:  The amount of data that can be sent is not
            limited by the URL length.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use POST when you need to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Submit form data securely, such as login credentials or payment
            information.
          </li>
          <li>Upload files to a server.</li>
          <li>Create a new resource on the server.</li>
          <li>Send data that exceeds the URL length limit.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>Security is a critical factor in choosing between GET and POST:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            GET: Parameters are visible in the URL, making it less secure
            for sensitive data. Avoid using GET for transmitting passwords or
            other sensitive information.
          </li>
          <li>
            POST: Data is included in the body of the request, making it
            more suitable for sensitive information. Always use POST for form
            submissions that include passwords, personal data, or payment
            details.
          </li>
        </ul>
