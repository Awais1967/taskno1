      <h1>What is a Request?</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Overview of HTTP Requests</h2>
        <p>
          An HTTP request is a message sent by the client to a server in order
          to fetch resources or perform operations. Each HTTP request consists
          of several parts: the request line, headers, and an optional body.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Request Line</h2>
        <p>
          The request line is the first line in an HTTP request message. It
          contains the method, the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and the
          HTTP version. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
            </pre
        >
        <p>
          In this example, <strong>GET</strong> is the method,
          <strong>/index.html</strong> is the URI, and
          <strong>HTTP/1.1</strong> is the HTTP version.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Request Headers</h2>
        <p>
          Headers provide additional information about the request. They are
          key-value pairs sent in the request message. Common headers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Host:</strong> Specifies the domain name of the server
            (e.g., Host: www.example.com).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User-Agent:</strong> Provides information about the client
            software making the request (e.g., User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accept:</strong> Informs the server about the types of data
            the client can process (e.g., Accept: text/html).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Request Body</h2>
        <p>
          The body of a request is optional and is used to send data to the
          server. It is typically used with methods like POST and PUT. For
          example, a POST request to submit a form might include data in the
          body:
        </p>
        <pre>
POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=John&age=30
            </pre
        >
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Common HTTP Methods</h2>
        <p>HTTP defines several methods, each serving a different purpose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>GET:</strong> Requests data from a specified resource. It is
            the most common method used for retrieving data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>POST:</strong> Submits data to be processed to a specified
            resource. It is often used for submitting form data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PUT:</strong> Updates a current resource with new data.
          </li>
          <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Removes the specified resource.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>HEAD:</strong> Similar to GET, but it only requests the
            headers of a resource, not the body.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Common HTTP Status Codes</h2>
        <p>
          Status codes are issued by a server in response to an HTTP request.
          They indicate whether the request has been successfully completed.
          Some common status codes include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>200 OK:</strong> The request was successful.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>404 Not Found:</strong> The requested resource could not be
            found.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>500 Internal Server Error:</strong> The server encountered
            an error and could not complete the request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>301 Moved Permanently:</strong> The resource has been
            permanently moved to a new location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>302 Found:</strong> The resource has been temporarily moved
            to a new location.
          </li>
        </ul>
