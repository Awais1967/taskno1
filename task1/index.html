        <h2>What is HTTP and HTTPS?</h2>
        <p>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundational protocol for data transmission on the web. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) adds security via SSL/TLS encryption.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>How is a web page downloaded?</h2>
        <p>Web pages are downloaded through a series of HTTP requests and responses between a client (browser) and a server, involving the fetching of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>What is a request?</h2>
        <p>An HTTP request is made by a client to request data from a server. It includes methods like GET and POST, headers, and a body. Common status codes are 200 (OK) and 404 (Not Found).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>When to use GET and POST?</h2>
        <p>GET requests are used to retrieve data from a server, while POST requests are used to submit data to a server. GET is for fetching, and POST is for sending data securely.</p>
